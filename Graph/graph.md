GRAPH:
=======

What is a Graph?
    
    Graph is a network consists of nodes and edges. It is also a set of points which are connected by links called edges.
    Graphs in which nodes have a direction is called Directed graph, otherwise called Undirected Graph.
    It is a non linear data structure.


What is a Cycle?

    When vertices joint together to form a loop is called a cycle.

What is Acyclic and Cyclic graph?
    A graph that contains at least one cycle is known as a cyclic graph. 
    A graph that contains zero cycles is known as an acyclic graph.


What are the applications of Graph?
    - Google Map for Navigation
    - Facebook friend suggestion is a graph in which nodes are users.
    - World wide web in which pages are vertices and if there is a link to another page, it act as edge.


What is a adjacency list and adjacency Matrix?
    - Adjacency list is an array consist of all linked list. First node of linked list is a vertex and remaining part is a list consisting of all the vertices connecting to this vertex.
    - Adjacency matrix is a 2D array of size VxV, V represent no of vertices. If there is an edge between 2 vertices (Vi Vj), then ViVj=1.
    - Adjacency matrix for undirected graph is always symmetric.
    - Both methods can be used to represent weighted graphs.
